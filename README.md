# QHack-2023

This is Constantine Quantum Technologies's solution to QHACK's Quantum Chemistry Challenge. The challenge ask to calculate the ground state of the  BeH2
molecule using quantum computation.

## Our Approach

We aimed to explore the functionalities of Qiskit and the many options provided to study molecular hamiltonians. In addition, we explored new ideas from literature to reduce the hamiltonian of $BeH_2$ and mitigate the errors of real quantum devices. Here, some of what we did so far:
1. Comparing different basis sets
1. Compare different mappings 
1. Compare UCCSD with Hardware Efficient Ansatz
1. REM (Lolur et al. 2023) 
1. BeH2 optimized circuit (Kandala et al. 2017)
